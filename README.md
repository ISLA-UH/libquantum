### Description
Standardized time-frequency representations 
built on Gabor uncertainty principle for 
logarithmic constant Q base 2 (binary) frequency bands 
of quantized order N.

NOTE: 
Requirements upgraded to run on Apple M1 Silicon chip 
with the RedVox SDK version 3.1.0 or later. Please read the notes on requirements.txt
